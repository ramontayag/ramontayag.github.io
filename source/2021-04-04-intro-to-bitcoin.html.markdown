# How Bitcoin is Valued
## Compared to Gold
When valuing a new type of asset, the most obvious way is to look at something that similar. Since Bitcoin is often touted to be digital gold, it's no surprise we look at gold to attempt to value Bitcoin.

Physical gold has long been the non-sovereign store of value without counter-party risk. Although the gold standard was severed in 1971, central banks today still buy gold. Gold's current market cap is roughly $10 trillion, the exact number being difficult to determine.

Bitcoin's current market cap is $1.2 trillion, and for Bitcoin to reach gold's market cap it would have to go 8.3x from here, or from $60,000 per Bitcoin to $498,000 per Bitcoin.

Even if Bitcoin reaches gold levels and not higher, the upside potential is massive, cementing Bitcoin as the best asymmetric bet one can take today.

Money has always been a technology, and nothing embodies this more than that money becoming software. Since Bitcoin is pure information, the shackles that limits gold have nothing to grasp onto when it comes to Bitcoin.

## Compared to Bonds
Total bond market is roughly $100 trillion. This is the amount of debt denominated in corporate and government bonds.

As yields go lower throughout the world, especially in the US, investors will be pressured to sell their bonds. Withdrawing cash and stuffing it under your mattress isn't a smart option. There hasn't been a credible alternative with no counter-party risk until Bitcoin matured enough.

I learned this fairly late in my Bitcoin rabbit-hole journey: these instruments are called "fixed-income" is because the yield/interest you get is fixed, regardless of the price you paid to for these bonds. That's because people buy and sell debt depending on their needs, and they may sell it higher or lower than they purchased it for.

The rates in the bond market, in particular the 10-year Treasury bond, guides other interest rates thus affecting all asset prices in the economy, including how companies are valued and how real estate is valued. This is also known as the "risk-free rate", because there hasn't historically been an instrument safer than the bonds that a government issues.

The risk-free rate is the keystone of a modern economy. This interest rate affects all asset prices in the economy because the way one values an asset that earns them income, whether through interest or through earnings, is by computing the future free cash flow divided by the discount rate. This is formula called net present value (NPV).

```
NPV = future_free_cash_flow / (1 + discount_rate)
```

In layman's terms, the discount rate represents how much less one values the money in the future, since money now is worth more than money in the future where there is less certainty. The riskier the situation might be, the larger this discount rate is. As with basic division, the larger the denominator (the number below the line) grows, the smaller the net present value is for that asset.

When it comes to Treasurys, what would make the situation more risky thus growing the denominator? There are two things relevant today:

- Inflation expectations
- Default risk (the chance that the government will not pay you)

Different people use different measurements to account for inflation. Some people look at M2 Money Stock (which is at about 25% in the past year), but most people look a government-chosen basket of goods called Consumer Price Index (CPI). When you hear reports talk about 3% inflation, they are most likely referring to the CPI.

Even if we take the CPI as our measurement, people already lose purchasing power with the 10-year Treasury bond because yields are at 1.7%. This means that by buying a 10-year Treasury bond, you lose more due to CPI inflation more than you make from the yield. What would a typical person do in this scenario? They would sell their bonds.

But there's a problem here. If people sell their bonds, that means there is downward pressure in the bond price, effectively raising the yield. If yields go up, assets purchased with leverage collapse (remember, all other rates are guided by the risk-free rate). Bought a house with a mortgage? Well, now the monthly payments you make go higher. If it goes up enough, people will not be able to make payments, and you can have housing collapse. The Fed doesn't want to this happen, because a collapse will spread to other parts of the economy.

The Fed has no choice but to buy those bonds to keep the facade up. This is why they have the moniker Lender of Last Resort. They will buy bonds even if no one else wants to.

Hang on, we're almost there. As central banks keep buying bonds and inject new money into the system, the risk of inflation increases, increasing asset prices in general and decreasing the yield one can expect from these bonds.

Central banks, in short, are trapped. The Fed is forced to buy from the government to keep the facade up, further exacerbating the problem that brought us here in the first place.

Insert sentiments about (from WBD w/ Foss or Pysh in Bitcoin Audible)
- inflation expectations
- CDS numbers

Debt to GDP 4:1.
25% of debt = $25T

Bitcoin is insurance against CDS blow-up.

## Global Reserve Asset
total global fin asset.. $900T. If btc global reserve asset, get 5%. $45T/21 M.

> It’s inevitable that if you own zero bitcoin right now, you are taking extreme amounts of risk.

# Risks

- Bugs, like inflation bug
- Macro liquidation events, like Marco 2020

# Trading Bitcoin

- Don't need to own a whole one, but only 21M will ever exist and ~4M lost
- Fees are by volume, ~1%
- Taxes - nothing specific in the Philippines

# Storage

- Self-storage
- Custodial
- Combination
