<p></p>

<p>Disclaimer: I am a newbie at this and using this blog as a way to journal my education.</p>

<h1 id="why">Why</h1>

<p>I’ve spun up a Lightning Network node with the intention of lending sats over <a href="https://pool.lightning.engineering">Lightning Pool</a>. I quickly learned that no one was taking up my offers to lend, and that was most likely because my node didn’t have a reputation.</p>

<p>I want to increase my node’s reputation so I may do a wider variety of things, like lend over Lightning Pool, more effectively.</p>

<h1 id="reputation">Reputation?</h1>

<p>A reputation is important to those borrowing because when they ask for that liquidity, they want someone who is more likely to be around than not. It makes sense: if you were borrowing and had two nodes offering the same interest rate, you would choose the one with a higher reputation.</p>

<p>One’s reputation has to do with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>uptime</li>
  <li>reliability in being able to forward payments (which implies a other things like well-balanced channels)</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems that the BOS Score is used to calculate the score of one’s node, but the score itself is proprietary.</p>

Though proprietary, it seems that Lightning Labs is at least going to clarify how it works. (Here's the [link](https://lightningcommunity.slack.com/archives/C6BPPDL7P/p1615914752001800), but it's a public Slack channel so it won't be there for long.)

<p>For now, the best way I’ve found to understand how to make your Lightning node get a better score is to listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlPIB6jt6ww">Alex Bosworth has to say</a>. Someone has kindly shared their notes <a href="http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/chaincode-labs/2018-10-22-alex-bosworth-channel-management/">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="ok-now-what">Ok, now what?</h1>

<p>Now that I have a vague idea of what reputation is, what do I do? The first thing I’m looking at is to connect to nodes and provide liquidity. Which nodes though? What assurances (doesn’t have to be 100%) I won’t be locking up Bitcoin and spending on transaction fees by connecting with a node that isn’t going to send or receive that much anyway?</p>

<h2 id="lower-fee-routes">Lower-fee routes</h2>

<p>While browsing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lightningnetwork">/r/lightningnetwork</a>, I found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lightningnetwork/comments/lb7pbk/last_month_i_collected_over_7000_sats_in_fees/">a post</a> that shared a tool that traverses the network and essentially returns a list of nodes that would likely help you increase your routing activity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea is that we want to choose channel peers who offer us the greatest benefit to routing diversity across the LN below a given feerate threshold. Since during the payment process LN nodes try lower-fee routes before moving on to higher-fee routes, by increasing the number of ways nodes can reach you/be reached by you at low fee rates, you increase the probability that your node will lie along a successful payment route and thus your share of the LN payments market.</p>

<h2 id="nodes-that-peer-with-many">Nodes that peer with many</h2>

<p>I have yet to read the code and understand what it does, but it is a start. As the author has stated, there are other ways to find out which nodes to connect to. I posed the “whom should I connect with” question in a pay-to-join <a href="https://t.me/LNBalancedChannels">Telegram group</a> (pretty cool, you pay sats) and got this advice:</p>

</figure>

<p>This is sounds logical, and I have yet to find/design a way to do this. Two thoughts immediately come to mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Look at a graph and visually select these nodes</li>
  <li>Write a script that returns a list of these nodes</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, if the first option can do it, I’d rather stick to that, but it also can’t be automated because I’ll be relying on my vision to do so.</p>

<p>I can also imagine combining these tools together: find nodes that peer with many and run that through the lower-fee routes script.</p>

<h1 id="end">End</h1>

<p>I’ll be posting more as I learn more. These series of posts will not be as polished as the others I share around since they act more like notes than anything else.</p>
